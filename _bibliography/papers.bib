  abstract = "The natural history of cancers can be understood through the lens
              of evolution given that the driving forces of cancer development
              are mutation and selection of fitter clones. Cancer growth and
              progression are spatial processes that involve the breakdown of
              normal tissue organization, invasion and metastasis. For these
              reasons, spatial patterns are an integral part of histological
              tumour grading and staging as they measure the progression from
              normal to malignant disease. Furthermore, tumour cells are part
              of an ecosystem of tumour cells and their surrounding tumour
              microenvironment. A range of new spatial genomic, transcriptomic
              and proteomic technologies offers new avenues for the study of
              cancer evolution with great molecular and spatial detail. These
              methods enable precise characterizations of the tumour
              microenvironment, cellular interactions therein and
              micro-anatomical structures. In conjunction with spatial
              genomics, it emerges that tumours and microenvironments
              co-evolve, which helps explain observable patterns of
              heterogeneity and offers new routes for therapeutic
              interventions.",

              wiring diagrams of tissues in health and disease, but
              comprehensive mapping of cell types in situ remains a challenge.
              Here we present сell2location, a Bayesian model that can resolve
              fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomic data and create
              comprehensive cellular maps of diverse tissues. Cell2location
              accounts for technical sources of variation and borrows
              statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling the
              integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with
              higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools. We
              assessed cell2location in three different tissues and show
              improved mapping of fine-grained cell types. In the mouse brain,
              we discovered fine regional astrocyte subtypes across the
              thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we spatially
              mapped a rare pre-germinal center B cell population. In the human
              gut, we resolved fine immune cell populations in lymphoid
              follicles. Collectively, our results present сell2location as a
              versatile analysis tool for mapping tissue architectures in a
              comprehensive manner.",

  abstract = "Genome sequencing of cancers often reveals mosaics of different
              subclones present in the same tumour1-3. Although these are
              believed to arise according to the principles of somatic
              evolution, the exact spatial growth patterns and underlying
              mechanisms remain elusive4,5. Here, to address this need, we
              developed a workflow that generates detailed quantitative maps of
              genetic subclone composition across whole-tumour sections. These
              provide the basis for studying clonal growth patterns, and the
              histological characteristics, microanatomy and microenvironmental
              composition of each clone. The approach rests on whole-genome
              sequencing, followed by highly multiplexed base-specific in situ
              sequencing, single-cell resolved transcriptomics and dedicated
              algorithms to link these layers. Applying the base-specific in
              situ sequencing workflow to eight tissue sections from two
              multifocal primary breast cancers revealed intricate subclonal
              growth patterns that were validated by microdissection. In a case
              of ductal carcinoma in situ, polyclonal neoplastic expansions
              occurred at the macroscopic scale but segregated within
              microanatomical structures. Across the stages of ductal carcinoma
              in situ, invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis, subclone
              territories are shown to exhibit distinct transcriptional and
              histological features and cellular microenvironments. These
              results provide examples of the benefits afforded by spatial
              genomics for deciphering the mechanisms underlying cancer
              evolution and microenvironmental ecology.",
