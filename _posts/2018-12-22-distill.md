## Introduction

<div class="l-body">

</div>

The wonders of population genetics allow us to reveal the echoes of the tumultuous times our ancestors survived, forever imprinted in our genome. In this thread, I'll share my experience replicating one of my all-time favourite paper "Inference of human population history from individual whole-genome sequences"<d-cite key="Li2011-nn"></d-cite> by 
[Heng Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heng_Li) and [Richard M. Durbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Durbin). The paper introduces the method to infer population size history from a single genome. Meaning, you give it a genomic sequence and it outputs all changes in ancestral effective population size on a time scale from ~10,000 to ~10,000,000 years ago. How?

## Basics of coalescence theory

Let's start with the basics. Humans inherit two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, each with their own distinct mutations. By knowing the mutation rate, we can estimate when the most recent common ancestor (MRCA), who possessed the original version of the DNA, lived.

<div class="l-body">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/psmc/psmc_1-08.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

In the absence of recombination, we can estimate one MRCA per chromosome, as each generation discards one parental chromosome. Recombination allows for the exchange of genetic information between chromosome sets, retaining fragments of parental variation for future generations.

<div class="l-body">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/psmc/psmc_1-01.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

This implies that our chromosomes are a mosaic of thousands of fragments, each originating from thousands of ancestors spread across millions of years! A single chromosome holds a rich tapestry of our ancestral history.

The distribution of the MRCAs is important. According to coalescent theory, this distribution follows an exponent, assuming a constant effective population size (ùó°ùó≤). ùó°ùó≤ is an abstract value influenced by factors such as number of individuals and population structure.

<div class="l-body">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/psmc/psmc_1-02.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

A direct relationship exists between ùó°ùó≤ at a given time and the probability of coalescence events. Larger populations have lower probabilities; conversely, during a population bottleneck, the number of coalescence events (MRCAs) rises for the corresponding time period.

## PSMC model

In practice, we don't know where crossover breakpoints happened. The authors designed a sequential hidden Markov model (HMM) to directly link population size history and genome sequence heterozygosity.

<div class="l-body">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/psmc/psmc_1-05.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

The paper's achievement lies in deriving the math required to define this HMM, assuming a Markovian process. Though a strong assumption, as the saying goes, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." This model has indeed proven to be both effective and useful.

Given the length of the genome sequence, computing probabilities of latent variables is very costly. So training this beast is more manageable using the EM-algorithm. Instead of directly maximising the likelihood, EM employs a lower bound that is more cost-effective to maximise.

## Python implementation

The paper's achievement lies in deriving the math required to define this HMM, assuming a Markovian process. Though a strong assumption, as the saying goes, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." This model has indeed proven to be both effective and useful.

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Simulated data study

At first, I tested it on 300 Mb synthetic data, roughly the size of the 1st chromosome. Results look similar to the paper, with pitfalls such as low accuracy on time intervals before ~10K years and above ~2M years, and oversmoothing of rapid step-like population size changes.

## Real human genomes and our unique history

Now the fun part ‚Äì what could real genomes tell? I run PSMC on the chromosomes 1-5 for six individuals: three of diverse African origins (San, Mbuti, and Maasai), a European (French), an East Asian (Japanese), and an Austronesian (Ami). Genome data is from [The International Genome Sample Resource](https://internationalgenome.org).

<div class="l-body">
  {% include figure.html path="assets/img/psmc/psmc_1-07.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

It's evident that all humans shared similar history until approximately 150K years ago, surviving a significant bottleneck around 1M years ago. This bottleneck appears to be embedded not only in our DNA but also in fossil records. Climate change may be a factor, among others.

Approximately 150,000 years ago, the history of the selected individuals' ancestors diverged. The noteworthy bottleneck experienced by all migrating populations (üü¶) was surprisingly similar, despite the vast distances between their descendants.

In contrast, the ancestors of African populations (üü•) had remarkably different histories, resulting in a decline in effective population size concurrent with their relatives' migrations to Eurasia. The Toba volcanic eruption is among the hypotheses to explain this phenomenon.

By correlating inferred population sizes with archaeological data, it's tempting to speculate about causality. E.g., did the use of üî• or increasing üß† volume aided the recovery from the bottleneck 1M years ago? However, as with any model, ùó°ùó≤ is to be interpreted with care

## Afterword

A little story at the end. Why did I spend time on this instead of working on my thesis? 

Well, partly because this method is just awesome. Partly because I really wanted to play with HMMs and EM. But also, because I made a promise to myself at the beginning of my PhD to try. During my PhD interview with @Nick_Goldman, I shared this as my favourite paper, acknowledging my limited understanding of how the method works. Nick then asked me how long it'd take to replicate if the math is provided, and I somewhat naively replied, "I guess three weeks?ü§î".

It took me numerous evenings of dedicated effort to replicate the task at hand. As someone with limited computational experience four years ago, I cannot stress enough how much of an underestimation the "three weeks" suggestion was.
