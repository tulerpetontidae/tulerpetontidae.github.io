  abstract = "The history of human population size is important for
              understanding human evolution. Various studies have found
              evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and
              European populations, associated with the human dispersal
              out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However,
              these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models
              with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for
              the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer
              assumptions on population size changes, we present a more
              detailed history of human population sizes between approximately
              ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise
              sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete
              diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male
              (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and
              NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and
              NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very
              similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both
              populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago,
              whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from
              which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an
              elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago,
              possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the
              differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as
              early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may
              still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago.",

  author   = "Nachman, M W and Crowell, S L",
  abstract = "Many previous estimates of the mutation rate in humans have
              relied on screens of visible mutants. We investigated the rate
              and pattern of mutations at the nucleotide level by comparing
              pseudogenes in humans and chimpanzees to (i) provide an estimate
              of the average mutation rate per nucleotide, (ii) assess
              heterogeneity of mutation rate at different sites and for
              different types of mutations, (iii) test the hypothesis that the
              X chromosome has a lower mutation rate than autosomes, and (iv)
              estimate the deleterious mutation rate. Eighteen processed
              pseudogenes were sequenced, including 12 on autosomes and 6 on
              the X chromosome. The average mutation rate was estimated to be
              approximately 2.5 x 10(-8) mutations per nucleotide site or 175
              mutations per diploid genome per generation. Rates of mutation
              for both transitions and transversions at CpG dinucleotides are
              one order of magnitude higher than mutation rates at other sites.
              Single nucleotide substitutions are 10 times more frequent than
              length mutations. Comparison of rates of evolution for X-linked
              and autosomal pseudogenes suggests that the male mutation rate is
              4 times the female mutation rate, but provides no evidence for a
              reduction in mutation rate that is specific to the X chromosome.
              Using conservative calculations of the proportion of the genome
              subject to purifying selection, we estimate that the genomic
              deleterious mutation rate (U) is at least 3. This high rate is
              difficult to reconcile with multiplicative fitness effects of
              individual mutations and suggests that synergistic epistasis
              among harmful mutations may be common.",

              genotyped 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families, with a
              total of 1,257 meiotic events, to build a high-resolution genetic
