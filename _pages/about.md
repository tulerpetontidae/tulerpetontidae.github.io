  I am nearing the completion of my PhD at the University of Cambridge, that is shared between 
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Wellcome Sanger Institute</a>, and 
  <a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html">DKFZ</a>. 
  My research has been advised by 
  <a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/AI-in-oncology/Employees_detailed/Moritz_Detail.html">Moritz Gerstung</a> 
  and

  My scientific work brings together recent advancements in <strong>spatial genomics</strong> technologies and Bayesian data modelling. By collecting diverse data modalities, I aim to integrate information on the <strong>genotype</strong>, <strong>phenotype</strong> and <strong>spatial environment</strong> - the essential triad for elucidating cell behaviour from an evolutionary standpoint. This approach offers a deep understanding of cancer progression within an individual and promises to shed light on the fundamental questions of cancer development:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much of tumour heterogeneity is attributed to the irreversible state changes caused by mutations vs reversible cell plasticity?</li>
  <li>How do cancer cells evolve within the constraints of the native tissue environment?</li>
  <li>Why do some cancer evolutionary branches lead to the disease progression while others remain dormant?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Beyond cancer biology, Iâ€™m broadly interested in understanding the mechanisms of <strong>cellular plasticity</strong> and <strong>somatic evolution</strong> in natural tissues. While cancer is a prominent example of a disease with a strong genetic component, it is just one of many deregulations that arise from a cascade of cellular and tissue-level changes triggered by <strong>ageing</strong>. Given my computational background, I hope to design algorithms for modelling and potentially reversing age-related diseases. My aspiration is to create a comprehensive multimodal dataset for constructing a unified cell model that links phenotypic and genetic changes with cell signalling. Acknowledging limited resources, I also prioritise hypothesis-driven research and the creation of specialised algorithms for specific challenges.

  In addition to my main research activities, I take pleasure in exploring fun little projects and try to document them in my <a href="blog">blog</a>.
